##### Known issues and solutions/workarounds

Output-folder of gradle and intellij differ which leads to duplicate files errors (see link on link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45174989/building-with-intellij-2017-2-out-directory-duplicates-files-in-build-director/46035904#46035904[SO]).

What you can do:

* Delegate IDE build to gradle: Every build in Intellij will be execute by underlying gradle
** Set here: Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment ->Build Tools -> Gradle -> Runner
** Disadvantage: Builds are much slower in Intellij
* Set same output folder (e.g. via gradle)
** Disadvantage: simply did not work smooth.
There were a lot of issues afterwards, e.g. building in gradle incl. the UI needed different copy targets for UI than in Intellij build.
* Leave everything as is: if building in Intellij you get folder _out_, in gradle you get folder _build_.
If they are overlapping, delete the one folder that is not needed.
